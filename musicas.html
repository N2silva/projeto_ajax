<h2>Cartoon On & On</h2>

[Verse 1] <br>
Hold me close 'til I get up<br>
Time is barely on our side<br>
I don't wanna waste what's left<br>
The storms we chase are leadin' us<br>
And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah<br>
No, I don't wanna waste what's left<br>

[Chorus]<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
On we'll go<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Finding life along the way<br>
Melodies we haven't played<br>
No, I don't want no rest<br>
Echoin' around these walls<br>
Fighting to create a song (yeah)<br>
I don't wanna miss a beat<br>

[Chorus]<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>

[Bridge]<br>
And we'll grow in number<br>
Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon<br>
Turn us to thousands<br>
And we'll grow in number<br>
Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon<br>
Turn us to thousands<br>

[Chorus]<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
'Til my shadow turns to sunrays<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>
Through the wastelands, through the highways<br>
And on and on we'll go<br>

<h2>Spektrem-Shine</h2>

Eyes, in the sky, gazing far into the night<br>
I raise my hand to the fire, but it's no use<br>
'Cause you can't stop it from shining through<br>
It's true<br>
Baby let the light shine through<br>
If you believe it's true<br>
Baby won't you let the light shine through<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
Won't you let the light shine through<br>
Eyes, in the sky, gazing far into the night<br>
I raise my hand to the fire, but it's no use<br>
'Cause you can't stop it from shining through<br>
It's true<br>
Baby let the light shine through<br>
If you believe it's true<br>
Baby won't you let the light shine through<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>
For you<br>

<h2>Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [NCS Release]</h2>

I'm walking alone, the streets are empty<br>
The only thing I can see is my own silhouette<br>
I'm getting stronger, step by step<br>
The clock is ticking, but there's no time for regrets<br>

I've been flying from town to town<br>
From London to Taiwan<br>
I've been all around the globe<br>
Tryin' to protect your soul<br>

We are heroes tonight<br>
We will fly above the sky<br>
We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>
We are heroes tonight<br>
We will fly above the sky<br>
We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>

Night, yeah<br>

I'm feeling like a dynamite<br>
Ready to explode right up in the sky<br>
I need you to listen, I need you to hear<br>
And don't show any fear<br>

I've been flying from town to town<br>
From London to Taiwan<br>
I've been all around the globe<br>
Trying to protect your soul<br>

We are heroes tonight<br>
We will fly above the sky<br>
We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>
We are heroes tonight<br>
We will fly above the sky<br>
We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>

We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>

Night, yeah<br>
We are heroes tonight<br>
We will fly above the sky<br>
We are heroes tonight, yeah<br>

I've been flying from town to town<br>
From London to Taiwan<br>
I've been all around the globe<br>
Trying to protect your soul<br>
